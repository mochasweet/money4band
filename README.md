**|Easy automatic multi app passive income project with Webdasboard, Auto Updater and Proxy Support:dollar::satisfied::+1:|**
## :information_source: Info
**Money4Band Leverages unused internet bandwidth allowing you to make money with something you have and would otherwise be wasted.** It use containerized version of apps like EarnApp, Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, PacketStream, Peer2Profit, Repocket, Proxyrack, Proxylite, Bitping and so on but it's also safer than installing and using these native apps on your host system. More info and FAQ in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki).

- This is a multiplatform, self updating, lightweight docker stack that runs many passive income applications that pay you in USD or in crypto to share your unused internet bandwidth. This docker stack makes it easier to set up and use those apps and it also includes an auto updater, multiproxy support, notification system and web dashboard.

- This is a set and forget project, just follow the automatic setup steps and start earning something doing nothing.

This Docker Stack should work on anything that may have docker installed. In particular, it has been tested on: 
| | Windows 11 x86_64\amd64 | Linux Ubuntu x86_64\amd64 | Raspbian OS arm64 | MacOS Intel x86_64 | MacOS silicon arm64 |

:green_circle:: All functions supported, Auto/manual setup supported
:yellow_circle:: All functions supported but not tested, Auto/manual setup supported

### Prerequisites
- A 64-bit operating system is strongly recommended.
- Virtualization functions in the BIOS must be active to use Docker.
- Docker should already be installed and able to run on startup. If it is not already installed follow the instructions for your platform at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ or use the guided setup script function to install it.
- (Optional) on Windows, Virtualization platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux should be active as this functions are required by Docker. If they're not already enabled, please enable them or use the guided setup script function to turn them on and install Docker.
- (Optional) On arm devices (such as Raspberry) to support non-arm native docker images it is strongly recommended to install an emulation layer and set it as a service to start automatically: The automatic guided setup will try to install it for you or you can do it manually following the steps explained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) prerequisites page.

### 3):technologist: Complete the automatic guided setup using runme.sh or runme.ps1
* (On linux) open a terminal in the project folder or navigate to it then use the following commands to add execute permission and run the guided script to configure the .env file and then start the stack:
  - ```sudo chmod +x runme.sh && ./runme.sh ```

* (On Windows) Open a Powershell (as Administrator) in the project folder or navigate to it then use the following commands to set the execution policy and run the guided script to configure the .env file and then start the stack:
  - ```Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; .\runme.ps1 ```

:information_source: Within the script menu there are many options dedicated to:
- Register for the various apps,
- Automatically install docker for the less experienced who cannot perform the manual installation,
- Setup of the .env file,
- Application stack start/stop helper,
- Tools to reset the configurations made in case of problems.
- Other useful tools and functions

:information_source: If you already have docker installed the only mandatory items you need to use are the env file setup entry and the start app stack entry of the menu.

### 4) :money_mouth_face: Enjoy your passive income

- While the docker stack is running you can access the web dashboard navigating with your browser to http://localhost:8081/
- Keep in mind if you have several ip, you can run a stack on each ip to increase revenue, but running several time this stack on same ip should not give you more. 
- You can also install some of this apps on your smartphone and use also your mobile network to earn more.
- You could also run this project on servers or in cloud (check your provider ToS)
- You can also use proxyes to run multiple instances on the same machine just setting up the project in different folders and running the setup script again using different proxies (Check your provider and apps ToS).
